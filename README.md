# Introduction

This repository contains only the hardware development files. The server and app files are the property of my contributor Karoline.

This project is - as the name says - an automatic pet feeder projected to be made with some cheap and easy-to-find materials. There isn't a mechanical project yet, but I want to implement that someday.

# Usage

After mounted, the feeder can be programmed to dump the desired amount of food. 
The user can program the desired time and amount of food of each dump directly on the feeder's user interface or through the app.

Data as time, the weight of remaining food before dump, and some possible error during the dump, is sent to the pet's owner through the app.

The dump process consists of spinning two motors tied in a screw thread, moving the food into a pipe until a gate above the feeding bowl. The motors keep spinning until the programmed amount of food is dumped.
